Odin project: Recipes

In this first project in my Odin odyssey I will create a small website to display some useful cooking recipes.

I will be testing my knowledge on HTML. I should demonstrate proficiency creating several different pages, using links and images, and the different HTML elements (and their respective attributes) covered in The Odin Project lessons so far.
